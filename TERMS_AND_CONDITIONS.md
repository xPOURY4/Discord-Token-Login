# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 6, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Privacy Policy for Discord Token Login ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how your information is handled when you use our Chrome extension.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

At Discord Token Login, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We have deliberately designed our extension to minimize data collection and prioritize your privacy.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information or data whatsoever.**

Our extension operates entirely on your local device and does not:
- Collect any personal information
- Track your browsing history
- Monitor your Discord usage
- Transmit any data to our servers or third parties
- Use analytics, telemetry, or tracking tools of any kind

## Local Storage

The Discord Token Login extension uses your browser's local storage capabilities to temporarily store your Discord token on your device only. This information:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Is stored only for the purpose of facilitating login to Discord
- Can be cleared at any time by clearing your browser's local storage

## Permissions

Our extension requests minimal permissions:
- **Tabs permission**: This is used solely to detect Discord tabs and manage the login process. We cannot and do not access the content of any other tabs or your browsing history.

## Third-Party Services

Discord Token Login does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics providers, or data processors. The only service our extension interacts with is Discord itself, solely for the purpose of logging you in using your token.

## Children's Privacy

Discord Token Login is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. However, since our extension does not collect any personal information, these rights generally do not apply to your use of Discord Token Login.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any information handled by our extension. Since all data remains on your local device and is not transmitted elsewhere, the primary security consideration is your own device security.

We recommend:
- Keeping your browser up to date
- Using secure device passwords
- Being cautious about who has access to your devices
- Clearing your browser data when using shared computers

## Compliance with Laws

We are committed to complying with all applicable data protection laws and regulations. Our minimal data collection approach helps ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and others.
